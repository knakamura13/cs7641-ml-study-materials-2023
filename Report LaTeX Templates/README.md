# Overleaf LaTeX Templates

This folder contains Overleaf LaTeX templates. They are based on the IEEE format, but are extended with useful examples, comments for clarity, and improved file organization.

Each template includes:

- `template.zip`: Contains all .tex files needed by Overleaf.
- `sample.pdf`: Preview of the template as a PDF.

## How to Use

1. Download the .zip file for the desired template.
2. Go to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/login) and [log in with SSO](https://www.overleaf.com/sso-login).
3. Click "New Project" > "Upload Project."
4. Upload the .zip file. Overleaf will load the template and create a new project for you.
